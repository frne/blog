Some time ago, in school, there was a somehow funny situation: The prof was talking about object orientation and 
patterns. He came up with [SRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) but left out some 
important others. I asked if we will talk about all GRASP and SOLID principles, because in my personal opinion, they are 
part of "the basics".

His answer was not what is was expecting... He told me to prepare a talk about those principles in front of the class. 
And so did I:

I submitted my slides to him yesterday, and now I'm waiting for approval. I have held talks at developer
meetups, conferences and in different companies, but never at school. Looks like maybe I'm going to be a substitute 
teacher in the near future ;)

Feedback welcome.
